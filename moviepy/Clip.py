        fun
          A function with signature (gf,t -> frame) where ``gf`` will

          in seconds, `frame` is a picture (=Numpy array) which will be
          returned by the transformed clip (see examples below).

        apply_to
          Can be either ``'mask'``, or ``'audio'``, or
          ``['mask','audio']``.
          Specifies if the filter ``fl`` should also be applied to the

          Set to True if the transformation does not change the
          ``duration`` of the clip.

        Examples
        --------

        In the following ``newclip`` a 100 pixels-high clip whose video
        content scrolls from the top to the bottom of the frames of
        ``clip``.
